# PiBot
###### Python code to control robots
It's a work in progress where I bundle my efforts to make robots to play around with. There is no endpoint, no goal, just for fun. If I'm able to make an autonomous gundam that can do shopping for me, and save the world if needed, I'd consider the project a success.
