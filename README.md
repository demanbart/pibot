#PiBot
######A python module to easily couple a controller to a robot. 
It's a work in progress where I bundle my efforts to make robots to play around with. There is no endpoint, no goal, just for fun. If I'm able to make a autonomous gundam that can do shopping for me, and save the world if needed, I'd consider the project a success.
